WHATISTHIS
==========
This is a fork of phenny irc bot.  
The goal of this version is to be simple, extensible, with minimum modules possible.  
This version also supports (kinds of) hot load/unload/reload.  
Thanks to sfan5 this version also implements hostmasks for owner/admin identification.  


USE IT
======
1. Run ./phenny - this creates a default config file
2. Edit ~/.phenny/default.py
3. Move config file to phenny folder if you want
4. Run ./phenny - this now runs phenny with your settings


IMPROVE IT
